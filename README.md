# Code Refactor Starter Code
# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description


The motivation behind this project was to refactor already existing code. As part of my project I did my best to make the HTML semantic and sequential. I consolidated the existing CSS properties and combined attributes that were doubled and added comments to existing code. I learned quite a bit about how to clean up existing code and what to look for. I also enjoyed adding comments to the stylesheet and running through each selector with the 'live server' extension to see what each property did. All in all I enjoyed every aspect of this project and look forward to continue to develop the skills to refactor code well.
